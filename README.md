> MiniMOTD is a basic server list MOTD plugin for Paper (and Spigot) based servers, as well as Bungee and Velocity based
> proxies. MiniMOTD is compatible with servers running versions 1.8 up through 1.16 and newer, although RGB colors
> are only able to be sent from 1.16+ servers, and can only be seen by 1.16+ clients. (RGB colors will be automatically
> downsampled for outdated clients)
> MiniMOTD supports RGB colors and gradients through [MiniMessage](https://github.com/KyoriPowered/adventure-text-minimessage), which is also where MiniMOTD gets it's name.
> For more detailed info on formatting text, refer to the [MiniMessage docs](https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage.html).
